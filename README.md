One of the first pages for deskop only (at this point) created as part of a InfoShare Academy Junior Frontend Developer Bootcamp.

The purpose of the task was recreate page from image template to practice html and css.

Some ideas for improve project in the future:
- make website responsible
- add some animation (especially for smoth scrolling)
- contact form sent message to me :)
